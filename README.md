KickDrive
=========

KickDrive is a simple rakefile that will help you create a bootable CD/DVD or USB drive and load a kickstart config from a webserver. Right now it is nothimg more than a simple rakefile that helps you repackage an iso image. Further versions will hopefully integrate with a tool called 'kickplate'.
